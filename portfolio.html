        <p class="elon-musk">
          This Elon Musk tribute page was the first ever personal project I did
          after finishing the HTML and CSS section of my bootcamp. As you can
          see, the design was very simple with the logo on one side and some
          description on the other. The colour was all over the place and the
          design wasn't very symmetrical but it was a good introduction for me
          to apply the CSS and HTML skills that I just learnt into a real life
          project.

        <p class="wild-deodorant">
          This product landing page was a few projects after my Elon Musk
          Tribute Page. This project really helped me get comfortable with using
          flexbox as there were many different sections within the project. I
          believe this project was much more complex and really showed the huge
          improvements I made compared to the tribute page I made a month
          earlier. I learnt how to incomporate different designs for each
          section of the tribute page to mke it look fresh and dynamic.

          This parralax webpage was the project I did right after completing the
          wild deodorant product landing page. This was my first time using the
          parallax effects so I found it a little challenging at the start as
          found it difficult to style around the parallax image. Luckily, I
          eventually managed to figure it out and I believe it is my best
          looking project to date. I tried to incoporate the bright lights of
          new york city with the a little more of a dreamy/sad vibes. I hope
          this webpage could bring out a range of emotions to my viewers.
