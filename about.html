        Hello, my name is Christian Liew, and at the age of 19, I have already
        experienced a rather unique childhood that has greatly influenced the
        person I am today. Allow me to share a glimpse of my journey and shed
        light on what inspired me to embark on the path of acquiring the
        intricate skill of coding. <br />

      <p class="essay">
        Born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I had the opportunity to live in
        different countries throughout my childhood. Alongside my family, I
        spent significant periods in Hong Kong, Japan, and Malaysia. This
        multicultural exposure broadened my horizons and cultivated my
        adaptability and open-mindedness. <br />
        <br />
        At the age of 5, I discovered my love for tennis. The sport captured my
        heart, and I began training diligently to pursue my dream of becoming a
        professional tennis player. As I progressed, the demands of tournaments
        and rigorous training schedules started to clash with my academic
        commitments. Recognizing the need for flexibility, I made the decision
        to switch to homeschooling in grade 9, allowing me to dedicate more time
        to honing my skills and participating in international tennis events.<br />
        <br />

        Although I was homeschooled throughout my highschool career, I
        approached it with the same level of dedication I had for tennis. I
        undertook rigurous courses in the form of the IGCSE and A-level
        curricula. Maintaining good grades with intense tennis training and
        traveling became a challenging yet rewarding experience. Through this
        experience I was able to grow a lot as a person and it helped me develop
        strong self-discipline, and great time management skills .<br />
        <br />

        Upon completing my high school education, I found myself with a gap
        between finishing in November and starting college in September. I was
        eager to utilize this time productively and explore new areas of
        interest. With an open mind and a thirst for knowledge, I turned to
        coding. As someone who was homeschooled and primarily focused on tennis,
        I hadn't fully discovered my academic passion. Coding presented an
        exciting opportunity to explore a field that combined logic,
        problem-solving, and creativity.<br />
        <br />

        To embark on my coding journey, I initially enrolled in We Stride's
        full-stack development bootcamp. Unfortunately, the program's
        international division was discontinued shortly after I joined. However,
        it was through this program that I had the fortune of meeting Lea, a
        coding mentor who played a crucial role in my development. Recognizing
        our strong connection and her expertise, I asked Lea to continue
        mentoring me as I transitioned to Colt Steele's web development course
        on Udemy. Lea's guidance, patience, and industry insights have been
        invaluable, and our weekly meetings have provided a platform to address
        challenges and foster growth.<br />
        <br />

        My experience with coding has been both exhilarating and demanding. For
        example, I anticipated picking up JavaScript quickly, but it proved to
        be more challenging than expected. However, I persevered, recognizing
        that learning to code requires time, dedication, and continuous effort.
        While juggling commitments such as participating in the South East Asian
        Games and completing an internship, progress has been slower than
        anticipated. Nevertheless, I remain committed to mastering the course
        material and continuing my coding journey as I embark on my college
        education at Emory University.<br />
        <br />

        Looking ahead, I am considering pursuing a degree in computer science,
        allowing me to delve deeper into the fundamentals of coding. I am
        particularly interested in exploring Python and its applications in
        machine learning, including transformative technologies like ChatGPT.
        The prospect of contributing to the development of powerful AI that can
        improve lives excites me, and I'm eager to explore the possibilities
        within this field.<br />
        <br />

        Learning to code has revealed the power and practicality of this skill.
        It has become evident that not many individuals possess coding
        knowledge, and this realization has reinforced my belief in the
        importance of acquiring these skills. Currently, in my internship, I
        find myself as the sole person with coding expertise, entrusted with the
        responsibility of creating the company websiteâ€”a task that both
        challenges and motivates me. I am determined to deliver a successful
        outcome, knowing that it will serve as a valuable addition to my
        resume.<br />
        <br />

        My journey thus far has been marked by diverse experiences, intense
        dedication to tennis and education, and an unwavering commitment to
        self-improvement. Through homeschooling, I found the flexibility to
        pursue my passion for tennis while still nurturing my academic growth.
        Exploring coding has opened up a world of possibilities and ignited a
        desire to delve deeper into the realm of computer science. With each
        challenge, I continue to grow, adapt, and push the boundaries of my
        capabilities. I am excited to embrace new opportunities, expand my
        knowledge, and contribute to the exciting field of coding in pursuit of
        a future that combines technology and positive impact.<br />
